# Filmsystemet or FilmSystem
This project has been created for understanding of different type of API(Application Programming Interface). This project has fully focused on REST Architecture but project has been created by Minimal API but had option to created by MVC as well. 
In this project has SQL-Database and has been taken API key from TMDB(Millions of movies, TV shows and people to discover. Explore now.)

# Structure of Code:
Project has been generated by 3 layers of logic. Those are Models, Data, Business logic. Since project has been created through Entity Framework so, data migration has been interconnected.

## Structure of Project:
|   Tasks     |   Framwork    |  Effect  |
|-----|--------|-------|
|Database |   SQL   | Database has been created through EF Migration
|Model | VS C# & .NET Core 6   | GenreList, Movie, UserChoice, UserList
|Connection |  JSON   |  LocalHost Server
|Web-API |    REST-API(Minimal)     |  Get, Post, Put, Delete
|Demon-Loan |    Swagger     |  WeatherForecast

# Dependencies:
|   Nuget Packages    |
|-----|
|MicrosoftEntityFrameworkCore (6) |
|MicrosoftEntityFrameworkSQLServer (6) |
|MicrosoftEntityFrameworkTools (6) |
|Newtonsoft.Json (13) |

# Test API via Insomnia
=> Get all people in the system
https://localhost:7159/api/AllPerson - Get

=>Get all genres associated with a specific person
https://localhost:7159/api/Person/1/PersonChoise - Get

=>Download all videos linked to a specific person
https://localhost:7159/api/Person/1/Movie - Get

=>Enter and Retrieve "rating" on films linked to a person
https://localhost:7159/api/Person/1/Add/Movie/1/rating6 - Post
https://localhost:7159/api/Movie/1/Person/1 - Get

=>Connect a person to a new genre
https://localhost:7159/api/Person/PersonChoise?Name=MK&GenreID=1 - Post

=>Insert new links for a specific person and a specific genre
https://localhost:7159/api/Movie - Post

=>Get suggestions for movies in a certain genre from an external API, eg TMDB.
https://localhost:7159/tmdb/api/moviesuggestions/5 - Get

# Reflection:
Minimal API is primery stag of learning and understanding of API. MVC is much more secure and profeeisonal. I have learned how does work about API even I have leanred external API. I have used external API of TMDB. In this project could possible to generate TMDB genere information.
I haven't done repository pattern yet because this project has very little time understand. I will focused on.
